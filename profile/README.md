## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is eunomia-bpf project

eunomia is an organization oriented for exploring and improving the toolchains and runtimes for eBPF.

Our projects include:

- [bpftime](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime): bpftime is a High-Performance userspace eBPF runtime and General Extension Framework designed for userspace. You can extern eBPF to anywhere you want as a General Extension Framework, while compatible with current eBPF ecosystem. It enables faster Uprobe, USDT, Syscall hooks, XDP, and more event sources by bypassing the kernel and utilizing an optimized compiler like LLVM.
- [Wasm-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf): Cooprated with [WaseEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge), we build the first user-space development library, toolchain, and runtime for general eBPF programs based on WebAssembly, allows lightweight Wasm sandboxes to deploy and control eBPF applications in k8s clusters.
- [GPTtrace](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/GPTtrace): The first tool generates eBPF programs and traces the Linux kernel through natural language. With our AI agents, it can produce correct eBPF programs on 80\%, while a baseline of GPT-4 is 30\%.
- [eunomia-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/eunomia-bpf): A tool to help developers build, distribute and run eBPF programs easier with JSON and Webassembly OCI images

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is eunomia-bpf project


`eunomia-bpf` is a dynamic loading library and some compile toolchains, aim to help you build and distribute eBPF programs easier. Some command line tools are also provided to help you build, distribute and run the eBPF programs.

We have 3 main features:

- Write eBPF kernel code only with comments to build `CO-RE` libbpf eBPF applications
- Compile and pack CO-RE eBPF kernel code to a config file, eg. `JSON` or `YAML` format
- Write user space code for your eBPF program in `WebAssembly`, and  pack the program with a `Wasm` module
